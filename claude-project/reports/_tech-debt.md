# Tech Debt Registry

Track technical debt explicitly like bugs. Review weekly.

---

## Critical (Blocks Feature Work)

_Debt that prevents or significantly slows new development._

<!-- Example:
- [ ] **TD-001**: Legacy auth system needs migration
  - **Impact:** High - blocks SSO integration
  - **Effort:** 2 weeks
  - **Owner:** @unassigned
  - **Created:** 2025-01-01
-->

## High (Causes Frequent Issues)

_Debt that causes recurring problems or bugs._

<!-- Example:
- [ ] **TD-002**: N+1 queries in user dashboard
  - **Impact:** Medium - page load > 5s
  - **Effort:** 3 days
  - **Owner:** @unassigned
  - **Created:** 2025-01-01
-->

## Medium (Slows Development)

_Debt that makes development harder but doesn't block._

<!-- Example:
- [ ] **TD-003**: Test fixtures are brittle
  - **Impact:** Low - flaky CI
  - **Effort:** 1 week
  - **Owner:** @unassigned
  - **Created:** 2025-01-01
-->

## Low (Track for Later)

_Known issues not currently prioritized._

<!-- Example:
- [ ] **TD-004**: Could use newer React patterns
  - **Impact:** None - works fine
  - **Effort:** 2 weeks
  - **Owner:** @unassigned
  - **Created:** 2025-01-01
-->

---

## Resolved

_Completed tech debt items. Keep for 90 days then archive._

<!-- Example:
- [x] **TD-000**: Migrated from callbacks to async/await
  - **Resolved:** 2025-01-15
  - **Resolution:** Refactored auth module
-->

## Guidelines

### When to Add Debt

Add to registry when you:
- Skip tests to meet deadline
- Use workaround instead of proper fix
- Copy-paste instead of abstract
- Ignore deprecation warnings
- Hard-code instead of configure
- Disable linter rules

### Debt Item Format

```markdown
- [ ] **TD-NNN**: Brief description
  - **Impact:** Critical | High | Medium | Low
  - **Source:** [report-name.md] or [postmortem-name.md] (what identified this debt)
  - **Effort:** Time estimate
  - **Owner:** @username or @unassigned
  - **Created:** YYYY-MM-DD
```

### Priority Guidelines

| Priority | Criteria | Action |
|----------|----------|--------|
| Critical | Blocks features, security risk | Address immediately |
| High | Causes incidents, slows team | Next sprint |
| Medium | Annoying but manageable | Quarterly review |
| Low | Nice to fix someday | Opportunistic |

### Review Cadence

- **Weekly:** Review Critical/High items
- **Sprint planning:** Consider Medium items
- **Quarterly:** Audit full registry, archive resolved
